## Why from scratch?

My goal was to understand the basics of Neural Networks and their development both with basic Python (Manual Backprop) and Pytorch(loss.backward()). The idea was that if I understand this then I can work with other APIs and also other architectures. 
This also gave me the flexibility to play around with different aspects of optimization.
