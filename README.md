## Why from scratch?

My goal was to understand the basics of Neural Networks and their development both with basic Python (Manual Backprop) and Pytorch(loss.backward()). The idea was that if I understand this then I can work with other APIs and also other architectures. 
This also gave me the flexibility to play around with different aspects of optimization.

## How to Run?
1.  Choose the model of choice.
2. Add any dataset. I used the compliment dataset(https://github.com/ravsodhi/jibes-and-delights/blob/main/raw/FreeCompliments.csv) but any txt file should work. 
3. The files can be run using simple python <file name>.
4. Example: python lstm_train.py
